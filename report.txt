In this program I create a login page where you can create an account and then you can login with that credentials, once you logged you can decide your role in the program (user/superuser), i made this because i didn't have a memory of the role of the users.
After you do that you are in the main page of the program, there you can logout from your account and log with an other account, send a message to AI, start a chat and view your last N interaction. Here i had some problem with all the passage of the variables to all of the package but with some tutorial on internet and some question at an AI i resolved the problem.
If you log as user the program create an instance of the user class and if you log as superuser the program create an instance of superuser class so you can view the interaction of all of the user. Here I used the switch-case system instead of the if and elif system because I consider it better.
In the case 1 you can send a message to the AI, the message go firstly in the method of the user/superuser class then the message goes to the AI and finally it goes in the queue of rabbitmq, the message goes by producer and worker and the it got stored in my db.
In the case 2 the program made the same thing of the case 1 but it does this continuously until you type exit (loop cycle).
In the case 3 the program return a list with all the interaction (if you are a user only your interaction), then with the function pop() i flip the list and take only the N interaction that the user decide.
